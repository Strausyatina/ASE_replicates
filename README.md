# Prerequisites as input:

* Reference genome

* Two vcf files for maternal and paternal imbred line (should be "compatible" with reference genome)
  or
  Joint vcf file for multiple species, where two lines are presented (should be "compatible" with reference genome)

* gtf annotation for the reference genome

# Reference preparation:

## Pseudogenomes:

## F1-cross vcf files:

## Gene-Transcript-Exon Annotations:

...

# Pipeline-specific fastq aligning:

For different tools there is required an alignment with:

* Unique read placement

* Multiple read placement

# Pipeline specific bam processing:

#

# Replicates analysis:
